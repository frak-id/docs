# Press Interactions

Press interactions allow you to track user engagement with articles or other press content on your platform. These interactions are crucial for content platforms to measure and reward user activity.

## Product Dashboard Configuration

To properly handle press interactions, ensure that the "Press" product type is enabled in your Business dashboard.

## Available Interactions

The `PressInteractionEncoder` provides two main interactions:

### Open Article

Tracks when a user opens or accesses an article.

#### Input Parameters

- `articleId`: `Hex`
  - A hexadecimal string representing the unique identifier of the article.

#### Usage

```ts twoslash
// @noErrors
const interaction = PressInteractionEncoder.openArticle({ articleId: "0x123..." });
```

### Read Article

Records when a user has read or completed an article.

#### Input Parameters

- `articleId`: `Hex`
- A hexadecimal string representing the unique identifier of the article.

#### Usage

```ts twoslash
// @noErrors
const interaction = PressInteractionEncoder.readArticle({ articleId: "0x456..." });
```

## Related Types and Actions

- `PreparedInteraction`: The type returned by both `openArticle` and `readArticle` methods.
- `sendInteraction`: Action used to send the prepared interaction to the Frak Wallet.

For more details on sending interactions, refer to the [sendInteraction](/wallet-sdk/api/actions/sendInteraction) documentation.

## Example Workflow

1. User opens an article on your platform.
2. Your application prepares an "Open Article" interaction:
```typescript
const openInteraction = PressInteractionEncoder.openArticle({ articleId: "0x123..." });
   ```
3. Send the interaction using the `sendInteraction` action.
4. When the user finishes reading, prepare a "Read Article" interaction:
```ts twoslash
// @noErrors
const readInteraction = PressInteractionEncoder.readArticle({ articleId: "0x123..." });
   ```
5. Send the read interaction to complete the engagement tracking.

By implementing these interactions, you can accurately track user engagement with your content, enabling features like reward distribution or personalized content recommendations based on reading habits.
