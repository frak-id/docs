# How to Configure Your Product

To effectively run advertising campaigns, you need to have your product properly configured. This page will guide you through the steps to manage product funds, add or remove team members, and edit your product's configuration.

## Product Configuration Card

On your Frak Ads Manager dashboard, you'll see a product card representing your product's current configuration. This card contains the product name and quick-access icons for configuration management.

From this card, you can access the three main configuration areas by clicking the corresponding icons:
