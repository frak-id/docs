# useNexusClient

## Summary
The `useNexusClient` hook provides access to the current Nexus Wallet client instance within your React components. This client instance is used to interact with the Nexus Wallet and perform various operations.

## Requirements
- The app must be wrapped with `NexusIFrameClientProvider`.

## Hook Import

```ts twoslash
// @noErrors
import { useNexusClient } from '@frak-labs/nexus-sdk/react';

const client = useNexusClient();
```

This hook doesn't accept any parameters.

## Hook Return Type
This hook returns the `NexusClient` object or `undefined` if the client is not yet initialized:

```ts twoslash
// @noErrors
type NexusClient = {
  config: NexusWalletSdkConfig;
  waitForConnection: Promise<boolean>;
  waitForSetup: Promise<void>;
  request: RequestFn<IFrameRpcSchema>;
  listenerRequest: ListenerRequestFn<IFrameRpcSchema>;
  destroy: () => Promise<void>;
};
```

## Notes
- The returned client may be `undefined` if the `NexusIFrameClientProvider` is still initializing the client.
- This hook is typically used internally by other Nexus SDK hooks, but can be useful for advanced use cases or custom implementations.
- The client provides low-level methods for interacting with the Nexus Wallet. In most cases, it's recommended to use the higher-level hooks provided by the SDK.
- Use this hook with caution and only when you need direct access to the client for operations not covered by other SDK hooks.
