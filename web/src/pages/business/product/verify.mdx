# How to Verify Your Domain for Frak Ad Manager

Make sure no one else can use your domain with Frak Ad Manager.

## Why do I need to do this?

We don't want someone else to claim your domain name as a new product in the Frak Ad Manager. You can help us keep your domain safe by showing us that you are the owner.

You do this by updating settings for your domain at your domain registrar, not at Frak.

## How to Verify Your Domain

Every domain (like *your-company.com*) has a set of DNS records that can be viewed by anyone on the internet. DNS records tell computers how to find your website and where to deliver your company's email messages.

You'll copy a verification code from the Frak Ad Manager Product setup tool.

You'll sign in to your domain registrar and paste the verification code in to the DNS records for your domain name.

After your domain registrar publishes your verification code, we'll know you are the owner of your domain.

**To complete this task, open two tabs in your web browser:**

### Tab 1: List a New Product

1. Open [**business.frak.id/dashboard**](https://business.frak.id/dashboard) and click on the card **"+ List a Product"**. For more information, visit: [**How to list a new product**](/business/product/list).
2. Enter your domain name

### Tab 2: Sign in to your domain registrar

- You update your domain settings at your domain registrar's website, not at Frak Ad Manager.
- Make sure you have the account ID and password needed to sign in to your domain registrar.

**Note**: Frak Ad Manager can't sign in to your domain registrarâ€”only a domain's owner can do that. If you need help accessing this account, please contact your registrar.

    #### Who is my domain registrar?

    Your domain registrar is typically:
      - The company where you bought your domain name.
      - The company that hosts your website.
</Callout>


## Follow these instructions to add your verification code

### Step 1: Find your DNS records

a. Sign in to your registrar's website. This is usually the place where you bought your domain or where you host your website.

b. Open a new tab and sign in to your registrar's website. This is usually the place where you bought your domain or where you host your web site.

c. Select the domain you're setting up today and look for the place where you manage DNS records.

This page might be called:
   - DNS settings or DNS management
   - Advanced settings
   - Name server management
   - Control panel

*Important: If you have trouble finding DNS records, contact your registrar for help.*

### Step 2: Add your verification code

a. In the Frak Ad Manager, copy your verification code:

b. Switch to the tab with your registrar's website and create a new TXT record.

<Callout type="tip">
    - Look for a field called **Name**. This field might also be called **Host**, **Hostname**, or **Alias**.
    - Many registrars want you to enter **@** in this field. Some might want you to enter your domain name or a subdomain. Contact your registrar if you need help with this.
    - Paste the verification code you copied from the setup tool into the **Value** field. This field might also be called **Data**, **Answer**, or **Destination**.

c. Save your new **TXT record**.

    Your verification code will soon be visible to other computers on the internet.
</Callout>

### Step 3+: Tell Frak Ad Manager to verify your code

a. Return to the browser tab where you have the Frak Ad Manager open.

b. Click on the **Verify** button next to your domain name entry.

    You will see a message confirming that your domain name has been successfully claimed.

    The DNS update might take some time to propagate across the networks. It can take up to 10 minutes for the Frak verification process to recognize the change.

*If the Frak setup tool can't find your new TXT record, wait an hour before you try again.*
