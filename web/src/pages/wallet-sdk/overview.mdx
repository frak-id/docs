With the Frak Wallet, users can create an account using biometric authentication (fingerprint, facial recognition, etc.) and then seamlessly interact with decentralized applications (dApps). It eliminates the need for recovery phrases, pre-funded wallets for gas fees, and clunky browser extensions, providing a smooth and intuitive experience.

The Frak Wallet is fully compatible with the WalletConnect standard, ensuring compatibility with a wide range of dApps and Web3 services.
