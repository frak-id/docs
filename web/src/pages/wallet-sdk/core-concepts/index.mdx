# Core Concepts

The Nexus SDK provides a powerful set of tools for integrating Web3 functionality into your applications. To effectively use the SDK, it's important to understand its core concepts. This section will introduce you to the key ideas behind the Nexus SDK.

## Key Concepts

1. [Configuration](/wallet-sdk/core-concepts/configuration)
Learn how to set up and customize the Nexus SDK for your specific needs.

2. [Interactions](/wallet-sdk/core-concepts/interactions)
Explore the concept of user interactions and how they form the basis of the Nexus SDK's functionality.

3. [Delegated Sessions](/wallet-sdk/core-concepts/delegated-sessions)
Understand how delegated sessions enable gasless transactions and improved user experience.

4. [Rewards and Campaigns](/wallet-sdk/core-concepts/rewards-and-campaigns)
Learn about implementing reward systems and campaigns based on user interactions.

## Understanding the Flow

The Nexus SDK operates on a simple yet powerful flow:

1. **Configuration**: You set up the SDK with your specific parameters.
2. **Delegated Session**: A session is created, allowing for gasless transactions.
3. **User Interactions**: As users interact with your application, you track these interactions using the SDK.
4. **On-chain Recording**: These interactions are recorded on the blockchain, providing a transparent and verifiable record.
5. **Rewards and Campaigns**: Based on these interactions, you can trigger rewards or manage campaigns.

## Key Features

- **Seamless Integration**: The SDK is designed to work smoothly with both React and vanilla JavaScript applications.
- **Interaction Tracking**: Easily record user engagements and actions on the blockchain.
- **Reward Systems**: Implement token or NFT-based reward programs tied to user interactions.
- **Gasless Transactions**: Cover gas fees for your users, reducing barriers to interaction.
- **Referral Programs**: Set up and manage blockchain-based referral systems.

By understanding these core concepts, you'll be well-equipped to leverage the full power of the Nexus SDK in your applications. Dive into each concept to learn more about how they work and how to implement them in your projects.
