# Server side usage

The server side SDK is currently under discussion.

We are waiting for a few implementation feedback to polish our client SDK, and see what does company want for their server side.

If you are interested in one, don't hesitate to [create an issue](https://github.com/frak-id/wallet/issues/new/choose) on the github directly
