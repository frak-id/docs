# Overview

Welcome on the Nexus SDK documentation!

## Nexus Wallet

The Nexus Wallet is a EVM compliant wallet, developed from the ground up with user experience in mind.

It's built using [Account Abstraction](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4337), [WebAuthN](https://w3c.github.io/webauthn/), to ease your user onboarding and content related experiences.

In short, your users can create an account via biometry (fingerprint, faceID, etc.) and then use it to interact with your dApps.

No need to save this painful recovery phrase, no need to load your wallet with a few ETH to start performing transaction, and no funcky extension to install.

Ofc, the wallet is fully compatible with the WalletConnect standard, so it's usable on any type of wallet you want.

## Nexus Wallet SDK

The Nexus Wallet SDK is here to help you, fellow developers. This SDK provide a set of tools to ease the implementation with the Nexus wallet, and also provide you with a few perks depending on the app you are building and your need.

### You are a Content publisher

You can use the Nexus Wallet SDK to do some nice stuff:

 - Provide an alternative paywall solution (or a simpler login wall), exploiting all the latest blockchain tech, here is a few possible use-cases:
    - **Subscription gating**, unlocking access to all of your content for a given duration.
    - **Pay per view** where the user pay for each content he wants to access.
    - **VIP access**, where the user pay for a special access to a specific content.
    - **NFT gating**, where if the user own a given NFT, he can access your content
    - **Consumption gating**, if the user already consumed 15 articles of your content, he can access 1 paid article.

 - Track the consumption of your users, **deduplicate** his consumption across multiple providers, and propose him a **better experience** based on his usage.

 - **Reward** your users for their consumptions (or for their engagement), with a **custom token**, **NFT**, or access to paid content.

 - Engage your users by proposing them even more reward or perks using **mouth to mouth referral program**, etc.

And all of this, with a **smoother UX** for your user, a **simpler setup** for you, a **better tracking** of your user's consumption, a **better engagement** with your users, and of curse **fully decentralized** and **trustless**.

### You are a dApp developer

You can use the Nexus Wallet SDK to onboard your user with a smoother experience, and pay their gas fees for them (if you want to).

Implementing account abstraction has never been so easy, we basically do all the heavy lifting for you, and proposing you a simple interface to customise the smart wallet.
Then, you can easily use the Nexus Wallet as a regular wallet, with your current Wagmi setup.
