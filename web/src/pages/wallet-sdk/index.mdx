Welcome to the Nexus Wallet SDK documentation!

This SDK provides a set of tools and features to help developers integrate the Nexus Wallet, a user-friendly and EVM-compliant blockchain wallet, into their applications.

## Nexus Wallet

The Nexus Wallet is a cutting-edge cryptocurrency wallet designed with a strong emphasis on user experience. Built from the ground up using the latest technologies, including [Account Abstraction](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4337) and [WebAuthn](https://w3c.github.io/webauthn/), the Nexus Wallet simplifies the onboarding process and enhances content-related experiences.

With the Nexus Wallet, users can create an account using biometric authentication (fingerprint, facial recognition, etc.) and then seamlessly interact with decentralized applications (dApps). Gone are the days of memorizing recovery phrases or loading wallets with ETH to perform transactions. The Nexus Wallet also eliminates the need for clunky browser extensions, providing a smooth and intuitive experience.

Furthermore, the Nexus Wallet is fully compatible with the WalletConnect standard, ensuring compatibility with a wide range of wallets and dApps.

### For Content Publishers

The Nexus Wallet SDK enables content publishers to implement advanced paywall solutions leveraging the latest blockchain technologies. Here are some potential use cases:

- **Subscription Gating**: Unlock access to your entire content catalog for a specified duration.
- **Pay-per-View**: Allow users to pay for individual pieces of content they wish to access.
- **VIP Access**: Provide exclusive access to premium content for paying users.
- **NFT Gating**: Grant access to content based on the user's ownership of specific non-fungible tokens (NFTs).
- **Consumption Gating**: Offer paid content after a user has consumed a certain amount of free content.

Additionally, the SDK allows you to track user consumption, deduplicate consumption across multiple providers, and offer a personalized experience based on usage patterns. You can also reward users for their engagement through custom tokens, NFTs, or access to paid content, further enhancing user loyalty and retention.

### For dApp Developers

The Nexus Wallet SDK simplifies the integration of Account Abstraction, allowing you to onboard users with a smoother experience and optionally cover their gas fees. With the heavy lifting handled by the SDK, you can easily incorporate the Nexus Wallet into your existing Web3 setup, utilizing popular libraries like Wagmi.

By leveraging the Nexus Wallet SDK, you can provide a decentralized, trustless, and user-friendly experience while taking advantage of the latest blockchain technologies.
