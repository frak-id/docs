# How to Create a Campaign in Frak Ads Manager

Follow the steps below to create a new advertising campaign in **Frak Ads Manager**.

## Step 1: Campaign Name and Product Selection

1. **Campaign Title**: Start by naming your campaign. This is the internal name you'll use to identify this campaign in Frak Ads Manager.

2. **Select Product**: Choose the product (website) that you want to promote. This product must already be registered in your Frak Ads Manager.

## Step 2: Funding Bank

3. **Funding Bank**: Select the bank account to be debited for funding this campaign. Choose the bank or payment method you have set up in Frak Ads Manager.

## Step 3: Set Your Campaign Goals

4. **Campaign Goals**: Select the primary goal for your campaign from the following options:
- **Awareness**: Show your ads to people most likely to remember them.
- **Traffic**: Redirect users to your website or app.
- **Registration**: Increase registrations on your website to obtain qualified data.
- **Sales**: Drive sales through your ads.
- **Retention**: Encourage your users to return to your website or app.

For each goal, you can select additional sub-goals like **Coverage**, **Link Clicks**, **CRM**, or **Loyalty**, depending on your campaign focus.

## Step 4: Declare Special Categories

5. **Special Categories**: If your campaign falls under a special category (e.g., ads related to sensitive topics such as politics, religion, etc.), declare it at this step.

## Step 5: Set Your Budget

6. **Budget**: Define your campaign's budget. You can choose between a daily, weekly, monthly, or global budget, depending on your strategy.

## Step 6: Choose Your Target Locations

7. **Country Targeting**: Select the countries or regions where you want your campaign to be displayed.

## Step 7: Set the Campaign Schedule

8. **Schedule**: Choose your campaign start date. You also have the option to set an end date or let the campaign run continuously.

## Step 8: Configure Price Range for Campaign Metrics

In this step, you'll define the price range for each campaign objective. The budget will be distributed between the **referee** and the **referrer** according to an automatically optimized allocation key. Frak will apply a **20% management fee** to support the campaign delivery and cover operational costs.

### Available Actions:

Depending the type of your product, here are the different available actions:

1. **Create Link**: Define a reward for users who create a referral link. If you want to incentivize users for simply generating the link, you can specify the price range here.

2. **Referred**: This option is selected by default. It indicates the reward for successful referrals, where users share a link and someone else interacts with the product. Define the minimum and maximum amounts to be rewarded (e.g., 0.1 EUR to 0.5 EUR).

3. **Purchased**: Set a price range for users who complete a purchase after interacting with the campaign. This action is critical if your campaign's goal is driving sales. Specify the **From** and **To** amounts in EUR for this metric.

4. **Watch**: You can set a price range for users who watch specific content. This could apply to video views, tutorials, or any other watch-based interaction. Enter the minimum and maximum amount in EUR.

5. **Read**: Set a price range for users who read specific articles or content. This is useful for campaigns that focus on written content. Define the range of rewards for this action.

### How to Configure:
- For each action, you need to specify a **From** and **To** value in EUR to define the reward range.
- Only the actions that are checked will be active for the campaign. You can leave other actions unchecked if they are not relevant to your campaign.

### Example:
- **Referred**: From 0.1 EUR to 0.5 EUR (pre-selected in this example).
- **Create Link**: From 0 EUR to 0 EUR (if not applicable, you can leave it unchecked).

Once you’ve set the desired price ranges for each action relevant to your campaign:

- Click **Next** to proceed to the next step of campaign creation.
- If you want to make adjustments to the previous settings, click **Previous** to return to the earlier configuration steps.

This step allows you to finely control how the budget is distributed based on the specific user interactions you value the most for your campaign.

## Step 9: Review and Publish Your Campaign

Once you've completed the configuration of all campaign details, you’ll arrive at the **Campaign Validation** screen. This is the final step where you can review all the information entered before publishing your campaign.

### Review Your Campaign:

1. **Campaign Title**: Check the title of your campaign and ensure it aligns with your marketing objectives.
2. **Special Advertising Catery**: If non, it is written "My campaign doesn’t belong to any special advertising category"
3. **Campaign Goals**: Review the campaign goals (Awareness, Traffic, Registration, Sales, Retention) and make sure you have selected the appropriate goals and sub-goals.
4. **Price Ranges**: Double-check the price ranges for each action (Watch, Read, Referred, Create Link, Purchased) to ensure the budget distribution matches your expectations.
5. **Budget**: Ensure that your campaign budget is set correctly, whether it's daily, weekly, or global.

### Publish Your Campaign

- Once you've reviewed all the information and are confident everything is correct, click on the **Publish Campaign** button.
- After publishing, your campaign will start running according to the schedule and settings you've defined.

**Note**: You will be able to monitor your campaign’s performance in real-time through the **Frak Ads Manager Dashboard** in the **Performance** Tab and adjust settings if necessary.
