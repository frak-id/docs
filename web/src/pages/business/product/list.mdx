1. Enter your **Domain Name** (e.g., example.com).
2. Before clicking **Verify**, make sure to follow the instructions in the page [**How to verify your domain for Frak Ad Manager?**](/business/product/verify). This page will guide you through the process of adding the correct TXT record for domain validation.

**Note**: If the Frak setup tool can't find your new TXT record, wait an hour before you try again.

3. Once your TXT record is set up and validated, come back to this page and click **Verify**.

## Step 4: Confirm and Validate

After successfully verifying your domain, review the product details.

1. Verify all the information you have entered.
2. Click on **Next** to proceed.

## Step 5: Validate with Biometrics

To finalize the product listing, you'll need to validate it using your biometric authentication (e.g., fingerprint or facial recognition). This step ensures that the product is securely linked to your account.

Once validated, your product will be listed, and you're ready to start creating your ad campaigns in Frak Ads Manager!
