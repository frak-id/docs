# Key Concepts

An introduction to some common terms and ideas in Frak Ad Manager.

Frak Ad Manager is a tool designed to help you run word-of-mouth advertising campaigns on your website. Unlike traditional ad platforms that focus on broadcasting to a large audience through social media, Frak is centered around amplifying customer-driven referrals. Below are key concepts that will help you understand how Frak is structured and how users interact with it.

## Product (Website/Domain)

In Frak Ad Manager, a product represents a website or domain name where brands can run advertising campaigns. The campaign is based on word-of-mouth marketing, meaning that customers become advocates who share product links with their network. [Learn more about products](/path/to/products).

## Push Notifications

One of the core features of Frak Ad Manager is the ability to create and send push notifications directly to users. Push notifications are short, engaging messages that promote a product or service, delivered directly to the recipient’s device. You can customize the message, add visuals, and track user interactions with the notification. [Learn more about push notifications](/path/to/push-notifications).

## Campaign Budget Allocation

Frak’s model is based on real-time budget allocation, where 20% of the campaign budget is taken as a fee, and the remaining 80% is distributed to customers (either referrers or referees). The budget is divided between different actions (e.g., referring a product, completing a purchase, visiting a website, watching a video, or reading an article). This allows for flexible and dynamic budget distribution depending on campaign goals. [Learn more about budget allocation](/path/to/budget-allocation).

## Wallet

A wallet in Frak Ad Manager is the central tool for tracking payments and rewards. When users participate in a campaign by sharing links, referring others, or making purchases, they accumulate rewards that are deposited into their wallet. The wallet is powered by blockchain technology, ensuring transparency and security in transactions. [Learn more about wallets](/path/to/wallets).

## Campaign Creation

Creating a campaign in Frak Ad Manager involves setting up the content, budget, and targeting criteria. You can create campaigns to promote products through user referrals and word-of-mouth sharing. Users are incentivized through the reward system, with real-time performance tracking. [Learn more about creating campaigns](/path/to/campaign-creation).

## Product Verification

To run a campaign, you must verify the domain associated with the product you’re promoting. This is done through a DNS TXT record validation process, which ensures that the domain is correctly linked to the campaign. Once verified, the product is listed in the Frak Ad Manager, and campaigns can be initiated. [Learn more about product verification](/path/to/product-verification).

## Performance

Frak Ad Manager offers a reporting tool that lets you monitor the performance of your campaigns in real time. You can track key metrics such as shares, clicks, registrations, purchases, and conversions. This data helps you adjust your campaigns dynamically, ensuring optimal performance and return on investment. [Learn more about reporting](/path/to/reporting).

## Member Management

The Member Management feature allows you to track and organize the individuals participating in your campaigns, both as referrers and referees. It enables you to filter members based on actions, interactions, and rewards earned. This segmentation helps you target specific user groups for more personalized campaigns.
