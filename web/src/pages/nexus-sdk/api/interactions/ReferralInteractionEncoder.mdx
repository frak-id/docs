# Referral Interactions

Referral interactions enable you to implement and track referral-based campaigns within your application. These interactions are essential for platforms looking to grow their user base through user-to-user referrals and reward systems.

## Product Dashboard Configuration

To properly handle referral interactions, ensure that the "Referral" product type is enabled in your Business dashboard.

## Available Interactions

The `ReferralInteractionEncoder` provides two main interactions:

### Create Link

Records the event of a user creating a referral link. Note that this interaction doesn't actually create the link itself; it only sends an event to track that a link was created.

#### Input Parameters

This interaction doesn't require any input parameters.

#### Usage

```ts twoslash
// @noErrors
const interaction = ReferralInteractionEncoder.createLink();
```

### Referred

Records when a user has been referred by another user.

#### Input Parameters

- `referrer`: `Address`
- The Ethereum address of the user who made the referral.

#### Usage

```ts twoslash
// @noErrors
const interaction = ReferralInteractionEncoder.referred({ referrer: "0x123..." });
```

## Related Types and Actions

- `PreparedInteraction`: The type returned by both `createLink` and `referred` methods.
- `sendInteraction`: Action used to send the prepared interaction to the Nexus Wallet.
- `Address`: A type from the `viem` library representing an Ethereum address.

For more details on sending interactions, refer to the [sendInteraction](/nexus-sdk/api/actions/sendInteraction) documentation.

## Example Workflow

1. User A creates a referral link in your application:
```ts twoslash
// @noErrors
const createLinkInteraction = ReferralInteractionEncoder.createLink();
// Send this interaction to record that User A created a referral link
   ```

2. User B joins your platform using User A's referral link:
```ts twoslash
// @noErrors
const referredInteraction = ReferralInteractionEncoder.referred({ referrer: userAAddress });
// Send this interaction to record that User B was referred by User A
   ```

3. Use the `sendInteraction` action to send both interactions at the appropriate times.

By implementing these referral interactions, you can create a robust referral system that tracks user acquisitions and enables automatic reward distribution based on successful referrals.

## Automated Referral Handling

For a more streamlined approach to handling referrals, consider using the [useReferralInteraction](/nexus-sdk/api/react/useReferralInteraction) hook in React applications. This hook automates much of the referral process, including:

- Detecting referral information in the URL
- Handling wallet connections
- Sending referral interactions
- Updating the referral context

This can significantly simplify the implementation of a referral system in your application.

```ts twoslash
// @noErrors
const referralState = useReferralInteraction({
  productId: "0x...",
  modalConfig: { /* ... */ }
});
```

The `referralState` returned by this hook provides information about the current state of the referral process, allowing you to update your UI accordingly.
