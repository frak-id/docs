# React Integration Guide

This guide will walk you through the process of integrating the Nexus SDK into your React application. By the end, you'll have a basic setup that allows users to connect their Nexus Wallet and perform simple interactions.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure that:

1. You have a React project set up.
2. You have registered your product on the Nexus business dashboard and obtained the necessary configuration details.

If you haven't completed these steps, please refer to the [Getting Started](/nexus-sdk/getting-started) guide.

## Step 1: Install Dependencies

First, install the required packages:

:::code-group
```bash twoslash [npm]
npm install @frak-labs/nexus-sdk @tanstack/react-query
```
```bash twoslash [yarn]
yarn add @frak-labs/nexus-sdk @tanstack/react-query
```
```bash twoslash [pnpm]
pnpm add @frak-labs/nexus-sdk @tanstack/react-query
```
```bash twoslash [bun]
bun add @frak-labs/nexus-sdk @tanstack/react-query
```
:::

## Step 2: Set Up the Nexus Client

Create a new component to set up the Nexus client and iframe:

```tsx twoslash [NexusProvider.tsx]
// @noErrors
// [!include ~/snippets/integration/NexusProvider.tsx]
```

Wrap your main App component with this provider:

```tsx twoslash [App.tsx]
// @noErrors
import { NexusProvider } from './NexusProvider';

function App() {
  return (
    <NexusProvider>
      {/* Your app content */}
    </NexusProvider>
  );
}

export default App;
```

## Step 3: Check Wallet Status

Create a component to check and display the wallet status:

```tsx twoslash [WalletStatus.tsx]
// @noErrors
// [!include ~/snippets/integration/react-app.tsx:wallet-status]
```

## Step 4: Implement Login Modal

Create a component for the login modal:

```tsx twoslash [LoginButton.tsx]
// @noErrors
// [!include ~/snippets/integration/react-app.tsx:login-button]
```

## Step 5: Put It All Together

Update your main App component to include the wallet status and login button:

:::code-group
```tsx twoslash [App.tsx]
// @noErrors
// [!include ~/snippets/integration/react-app.tsx:app]
```
```tsx twoslash [App.tsx (complete)]
// @noErrors
// [!include ~/snippets/integration/react-app.tsx]
```
```tsx twoslash [NexusProvider.tsx]
// @noErrors
// [!include ~/snippets/integration/NexusProvider.tsx]
```

## Next Steps

With this setup, you have a basic React application integrated with the Nexus SDK. Users can now connect their Nexus Wallet and log in. From here, you can start implementing more advanced features such as:

- Sending interactions
- Implementing referral systems
- Creating reward campaigns

Refer to the specific action and hook documentation for details on implementing these features.
