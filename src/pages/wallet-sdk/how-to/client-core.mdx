# Core client usage

In this page, we will see the setup tutorial if you are building a client side application and you want to use the Nexus SDK and all the associated wallet features.

If you are using react, you can check the custom hooks and components [here](/wallet-sdk/how-to/client-react) page.

## Prerequisites

// TODO: Link to the mint content documentation

Before proceeding to the usage of the Nexus Wallet SDK, you will need to have a Frak content registered. To do so, please checkout the [Mint content documentation](https://frak.id/docs).


## Installation

First, you will need to install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install viem @nexus-wallet/sdk
```

## Creating the client

The SDK will use an iFrame to communicate with the Nexus Wallet. So first, we need to create our iFrame and the associated transport.
:::code-group

```ts [client.ts]
import { nexusConfig } from './config'
import {
    createIframe,
    createIFrameNexusClient,
} from "@nexus-wallet/sdk/core";
import type { NexusClient } from "@nexus-wallet/sdk/core";

// Create the iFrame and the associated FrakClient
async function createClient(): Promise<NexusClient> {
    // Create the iFrame that will be used for the communication with the nexus wallet
    const iframe = await createIframe(nexusConfig);

    // Build the client
    const client = createIFrameNexusClient(nexusConfig, iframe);

    // Wait for it to be ready
    await client.waitForConnection();

    // And then return it
    return client;
}

// Create the client and use it
export const nexusClient = await createClient();
```

```ts [config.ts] filename="config.ts"
import type {
    NexusWalletSdkConfig
} from "@nexus-wallet/sdk/core";

// Create the config for the Nexus Wallet SDK
export const nexusConfig: NexusWalletSdkConfig = {
    // The current url for the wallet sdk
    walletUrl: "https://wallet.frak.id",
    // The content id on which this sdk will be used
    contentId: "0xdeadbeef",
    // The content title, this will be displayed to the user during a few registration steps
    contentTitle: "My content dApp title"
}
```

## Watch the current wallet status

By watching the wallet status, you will be able to know if the wallet is connected, and if he is connected, you will be able to get his wallet address.

```ts
import { nexusClient } from "./client";
import { watchWalletStatus } from "@nexus-wallet/sdk/actions";
import type { WalletStatusReturnType } from "@nexus-wallet/sdk/core";

// Watch the wallet status
watchWalletStatus(nexusClient, (walletStatus: WalletStatusReturnType) => {
    console.log("Wallet status changed", { walletStatus });
    // You can now use the status to update your UI
});
```


## Watch the article unlock status

When opening a gated content, you will need to watch the unlock status to know if the user has unlocked the content or not.

```ts
import { nexusClient } from "./client";
import { watchUnlockStatus } from "@nexus-wallet/sdk/actions";
import type { ArticleUnlockStatusReturnType } from "@nexus-wallet/sdk/core";

// Watch the unlock status
watchUnlockStatus(
    nexusClient,
    {
        // The current article id, this will help you customise the unlock logics for each article if you want
        // For example, you can have different prices for different articles, or articles free if users has already checked other articles
        articleId: "0xdeadbeef",
    },
    (unlockStatus: ArticleUnlockStatusReturnType) => {
        console.log("Unlock status changed", { unlockStatus });
        // You can now use the status to update your UI
        switch (unlockStatus.status) {
            case "locked":
                console.log("The user hasn't unlocked the content");
                break;
            case "unlocked":
                console.log("The user has unlocked the content");
                break;
            case "in-progress":
                console.log("The user has launch the unlock transaction, it's in progress");
                break;
        }
    }
);
```


## Get the unlock options for an article

If a content is locked, you will need to display the unlock options to your user, so he can choose how he wants to unlock the content.

```ts
import { nexusClient } from "./client";
import { getArticleUnlockOptions } from "@nexus-wallet/sdk/actions";
import type { UnlockOptionsReturnType } from "@nexus-wallet/sdk/core";

// Get the unlock options
const options: UnlockOptionsReturnType = await getArticleUnlockOptions(nexusClient, {
    // The current article id, this will help you customise the unlock logics for each article if you want
    // For example, you can have different prices for different articles, or articles free if users has already checked other articles
    articleId: "0xdeadbeef",
});

// Display the options to the user
```

## Start an unlock flow

Once your user has picked an unlock option, you will need to start the unlock flow.

```ts
import { nexusClient } from "./client";
import { getStartArticleUnlockUrl } from "@nexus-wallet/sdk/actions";
import type { UnlockOptionsReturnType } from "@nexus-wallet/sdk/core";

// Start the unlock flow
async function launchUnlock(pickedOption: UnlockOptionsReturnType["prices"][number]) {
    // Build the unlock url
    const url = await getStartArticleUnlockUrl(nexusClient, {
        articleId: "0xdeadbeef",
        // The article title and image will be displayed to the user during the unlock process
        articleTitle: "My article title",
        imageUrl: "https://my-image.com",
        price: pickedOption,
        // The url on which the user will be redirected after the unlock process (can be the same url as the current one if you are watching the unlock status to display the unlocked content)
        redirectUrl: "https://my-article.com",
    });
    // Redirect the user to the unlock url
    window.location.href = url;
}
```
