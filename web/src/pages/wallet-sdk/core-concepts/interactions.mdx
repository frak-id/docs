# Interactions

Interactions are the cornerstone of user engagement tracking in the Nexus SDK. They allow developers to record on-chain events based on user actions within their applications, enabling features like reward systems and engagement analytics.

## How Interactions Work

1. **Session Initialization**: Users open an interaction session by sending a transaction. This can be facilitated through the Nexus SDK modal.

2. **Interaction Recording**: Once a session is active, user interactions are automatically sent on-chain without requiring further user action.

3. **Offline Support**: If a user isn't logged in or doesn't have an open session, interactions are stored locally in the browser and sent once a session is established, ensuring privacy and data integrity.

4. **Transparent Process**: The entire interaction recording process is seamless and invisible to the user, leveraging a delegation system specifically for interactions.

## Implementing Interactions

To implement interactions in your application:

1. Configure the appropriate product type in your Nexus SDK dashboard.
2. Use the relevant InteractionEncoder (e.g., `PressInteractionEncoder`, `ReferralInteractionEncoder`) to prepare the interaction.
3. Send the prepared interaction using the `sendInteraction` action.

Example:
```ts twoslash
// @noErrors
// Prepare the interaction
const interaction = PressInteractionEncoder.readArticle({ articleId: "0x123..." });

// Send the interaction
await sendInteraction(client, { productId, interaction });
```

## Benefits of Interactions

- **Engagement Tracking**: Monitor user activity on your platform.
- **Reward Systems**: Implement campaigns that distribute rewards based on user interactions.
- **Privacy-Preserving**: Interactions are only sent when a user has an open session.
- **Flexible Integration**: Easily incorporate into various product types and user flows.

## Best Practices

- Open interaction sessions as early as possible in the user journey.
- Use appropriate interaction types for different user actions.
- Implement error handling for cases where interactions can't be sent immediately.
